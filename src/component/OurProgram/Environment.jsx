            Shika Foundation Trust recognizes that environmental sustainability
            is crucial for the well-being of future generations. With the
            increasing impact of climate change, pollution, and deforestation,
            it is essential to promote sustainable practices and raise awareness
            about environmental conservation. Our commitment to protecting the
            planet aligns with our mission to empower communities and ensure a
            better quality of life for all.
