          WHY HEALTHCARE
        </h2>
        <div className="text-black/75  text-xl *:pt-3">
          <p>
            Shika Foundation Trust recognizes that access to quality healthcare
            is a fundamental right, yet millions in India, particularly in rural
            and economically weaker sections, lack essential medical services.
            With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, ensuring last-mile
            healthcare delivery remains a significant challenge. The
            geographical diversity of the country, including remote villages and
            underdeveloped regions, further limits accessibility and
            availability of medical care.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-2">
            Over 65% of the population resides in rural areas, yet they receive
            a smaller share of the healthcare infrastructure. Additionally,
            urban slum dwellers struggle to prioritize health due to financial
            constraints, making them vulnerable to preventable diseases. Lack of
            awareness, affordability issues, and insufficient healthcare
            facilities widen the healthcare gap.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shika Foundation is committed to bridging this gap by providing
            affordable, accessible, and quality healthcare services. Through
            medical camps, mobile health clinics, awareness programs, and
            partnerships with healthcare institutions, we aim to reach the most
            vulnerable communities. Our goal is to support the Government of
            India’s Ayushman Bharat vision and work towards Universal Health
            Coverage, ensuring that no one is deprived of essential healthcare
            due to poverty or inaccessibility.
